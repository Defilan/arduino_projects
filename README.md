# Family Arduino Projects
I recently started working on Arduino projects with my son who has really taken an interest in programming and electronics! While we are just getting started, this is already proving to be a lot of fun.

I'll try to keep this repo updated with our latest discoveries from the wonderful guidebook on [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/ArduinoStarterKit)!
